## üìç Overview

Shadcn Theme Editor is a user-friendly component designed to simplify the process of managing and customizing theme colors in Shadcn-based projects. This package provides an intuitive UI with buttons for different color properties, allowing developers to easily adjust and preview theme colors in real-time. Although the package is optimized for ease of use, its build size is substantial, so it is recommended to install it as a development dependency. This tool empowers developers to create consistent, visually appealing themes without diving into complex CSS, making it an essential addition to your Shadcn toolkit.

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

To install the package as a development dependency, use one of the following commands:

**npm:**

```sh
npm install shadcn-theme-editor --save-dev
```

```sh
yarn add shadcn-theme-editor --dev
```

```sh
pnpm add shadcn-theme-editor --save-dev
```

---

## üìñ Usage

**import default and add in `app/layout.tsx` file**

<!-- 
> **Tip**  
> It is preferable to use this component within the `ThemeProvider`, as follows:
`import { ThemeProvider } from 'next-themes';` -->

```tsx
import ShadcnThemeEditor from "shadcn-theme-editor";
```

or (in this way, it doesn't include the component in the production build)

```tsx
let ShadcnThemeEditor: any;
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
  import('shadcn-theme-editor').then(module => {
    ShadcnThemeEditor = module.default; // or module, depending on the module's export
  });
} else {
  // eslint-disable-next-line react/display-name
  ShadcnThemeEditor = ()=>null
}
```

and use

```tsx
<ShadcnThemeEditor />
```
